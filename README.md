# password-generator

## Description

This application will generate a random password based on criteria that users have selected like:

* How many characters they want in their password

* If they want lowercase letters

* If they want uppercase letters

* If they want numbers

* If they want special characters 

It has a clean and intuituve user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. 

## Usage

User will click on the "Generate Password" button and will be prompted to answer some questions about what they want included in their password. For whichever chracter type they choose, a validation message will appear right after telling them that they have chosen that criteria to be included in their password. After all questions have been answered, a random genereated password will appear in the textbox.

## Roadmap 

For better user experience, next time I would create a checkbox that users can select which character type they want instead of being asked through prompts. That way, users will be able to clearly see what their options are.
